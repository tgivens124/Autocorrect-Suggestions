# Autocorrect-Suggestions
This project imitates how autocorrect works on a mobilephone or laptop. 
When you type a word in, it gives alternate words as suggestions, taking the nearby keys intoconsideration. 
It utilizes a dictionary labeled "words.txt" and another file, "options.txt", for the possible alternatives. 
The program reads the word and comes up with the possible alternative words of same length from the dictionary.
